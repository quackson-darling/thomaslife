        <p style="font-size: 20px; "> Tom Holland whose full name is Thomas Stanley Holland was born on 1 June 1996 in the town of Kingston upon Thames, London, England to photographer Nicola Elizabeth Frost and Dominic Holland, a comedian and author. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; ">He has three younger brothers namely Harry Robert Holland, Sam Holland, and Patrick (Paddy) Holland. His paternal grandmother was from Tipperary, Ireland. Growing up his bestfriend was Harrison Osterfield. As his parents have such incredible and creative professions, Tom gets inspired by them often considering Dominic Holland his role model growing up.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px; ">Holland was educated at Donhead, a Catholic preparatory school in Wimbledon in Southwest London, followed by Wimbledon College, a voluntary aided Jesuit comprehensive school, up until December 2012. He was bullied in school for being a dancer and being diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of 7. </p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; ">After Wimbledon College, he attended the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology in Croydon. In his late teens, during a lull in his career, Holland briefly attended carpentry school in Cardiff, Wales.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px ; ">Growing up, Holland considered a number of paths for his practical life. As a child, he was a fan of Janet Jackson 's songs, and would be found often dancing to them. His mother, impressed with this, signed him up for a dancing class, which was advertised in the private school that Holland was visiting at the time. Thomas showed his excellence over there resulting in him being a great ballet dancer. 
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; ">Being a boy ballet dancer wasn't considered the best of all things by the society, but this didn’t stop him from doing what he loved. At one point, he even had the thought of becoming a primary school teacher, as he enjoyed being around children.</p>
